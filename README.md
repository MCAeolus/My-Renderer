Add shading, vertex culling and some other features.
Lots of broken things including
- broken indexing on corner values (viewport -> canvas -> canvas-0 index conversion)
- broken partial vertex culling/generating when performing model clipping
- lighting is broken (incorrect/weird specular value even when there is no specular?)
